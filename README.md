# ChatBot
A chatbot based on a well-known chatting AI and [mirai](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai)

## Run

The docker image built from `chat-api` and `chat-bot` should works.

Need to complete the installation and configration for `mirai` image manually.

I have not tested the docker-compose script :)

## Thanks
Thanks ChatGPT wrote the code python for me :)
